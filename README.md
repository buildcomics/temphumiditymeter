# Temperature Humidity Meter

This is the GitHub repository for https://buildcomics.com/uncategorized/ts-temperature-humidity-meter/.
It contains arduino code in the folder named "temphumidty"


## Wiring
The humidty meter is wired with one side to ground, the other one to D11.
The temperature meter needs two pins since it shows positive and negative voltages/currents. Wire one side to D3, and the other to D9.
The output DHT22 is connected to D2  
More specific wireing is in the comments of the arduino code 

## Plates
The plates (and intermediate steps) are stored as gimp files, check https://www.gimp.org for more information about that editor, it's free!
